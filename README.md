# cycle28 - Cycle Tracking Calendar App

![./resources/logo.png](./resources/logo.png)

## Why

Because the App Stores is full of bullshit period apps. Over-engineered, over-designed, none-private, childish... Nothing like a good old calendar.

cycle28 is a plain calendar for cycle tracking with its data stored on your local device, full stop!
